        <h1>2024 Spring Semester Plan/Schedule</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Front End: Feb 13th:</b> We hope to have a working version of all features implemented in terms of their front end functionality. This means all pages, buttons, and user interactions will be in place, 
                <br>but may not have their backend functionality completed.
            </li>
            <li><b>Feature Freeze: Feb 25th:</b> This is the last date we will be accepting new features to be added to the application, which means any new features should likely be discussed on Thursday the 22nd, 
                <br>the sponsor meeting before this deadline. This is done so that we have ample time to implement and complete everything.
            </li>
            <li><b>Backend Implementation: March 10th:</b> We hope to have all the backend functionality implemented by this date. At this point, the application should be in a mostly complete state, 
                <br>with all pages and interactions working mostly as expected (with a few bugs potentially).
            </li>
            <li><b>Spring Break: March 10th - 17th:</b> RIT`s Spring Break. We will not have a sponsor meeting this week, and we cannot be sure that the team will be available for communications during this week. 
                <br>We plan to continue work over the break in order to ensure we meet our deadlines.
            </li>
            <li><b>Testing Completed: March 26th:</b> We would like to have our code testing done by this date. This could also include any testing done by users on the WexEnergy side, if we are on user tests by that point. 
                <br>Will require further discussion once we are ready for testing.</li>
            <li><b>General Fixes: April 2nd:</b> We hope to have any fixes to bugs or issues discovered in the testing phase to be fixed by this date.
            </li>
            <li><b>Code Freeze: April 2nd:</b> Our code freeze is the day where we will no longer be working on the code of the application, regardless of the state it is in. 
                <br>We must try our best to stand by this date as we will have many deliverables to complete for RIT and the class towards the end of the semester 
                <br>and can`t get stuck on any final issues of implementation goals we didn`t meet. 
            </li>
        </ul>
