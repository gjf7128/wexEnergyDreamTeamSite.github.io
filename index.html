        </h2>
        <p>
            <br>WexEnergy is a company which sells WexWindows which are installed onto windows.  
            They reduce heating and cooling costs for buildings as well as their overall carbon
            footprint. 
            <br>It is our task to create a workflow app that will streamline
            the way their employees and other businesses capture the data needed
            for window installation and manufacturing. 
            <br>This App will be able to be launched 
            on any web and phone platform as we're utilizing the flutter framework.
