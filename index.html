        </h2>
        <p>
            WexEnergy is a company which installs windows in such a way that
            reduces heating costs for buildings which also reduces their carbon
            footprint.  It is our task to create a workflow app that will streamline
            the way their employees and other businesses capture the data needed
            for window installation such as Length x Width and more.  This App will
            be able to be launched on any web and phone platform as we're utilizing
            the flutter framework.

            <b>Methodology:</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            We are using the Agile Methodology and breaking our development tasks
            into weekly sprints.  We're using a Jira Scrumboard for both our planning and
            code development tasks.

            <b>Time Tracking:</b>

            Time tracking will go here once we figure out exactly how we're
            going to capture that information
