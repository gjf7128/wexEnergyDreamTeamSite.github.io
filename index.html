        <p>
            WexEnergy is a company which sells WexWindows which go on windows.  They
            reduce heating costs for buildings and their carbon
            footprint.  It is our task to create a workflow app that will streamline
            the way their employees and other businesses capture the data needed
            for window installation such as Length x Width and more.  This App will
            be able to be launched on any web and phone platform as we're utilizing
            the flutter framework.

        <p>
            We are using the Agile Methodology and breaking our development tasks
            into weekly sprints.  We're using a Jira Scrumboard for both our planning and
            code development tasks.
